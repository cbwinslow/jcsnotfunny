This issue is for enhancing existing tools or integrating new AI capabilities for keyword research and content suggestion, with a specific focus on local relevance to "comedy podcast roanoke, va".

**Description:**
To improve content relevance and discoverability, especially for local searches, this task involves leveraging AI to identify high-value keywords and suggest content topics that align with audience interest, search trends, and local context.

**Subtasks (from plan):**
- Enhance `scripts/seo_tools.py` or integrate with `scripts/ai_content_editor.py` (new tool) / `scripts/predictive_analytics.py` (new tool) to suggest relevant keywords and content topics based on episode transcripts, audience analytics, and search trends, with a focus on local relevance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system can ingest episode transcripts and analytics data.
- AI models generate a list of relevant keywords (including local terms) with estimated search volume and difficulty.
- AI models suggest new content topics or angles based on trend analysis, keyword gaps, and local relevance.
- The output is provided in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for further processing or human review.
