This issue is for implementing pre-commit hooks and CI/CD quality gates to enforce code quality and consistency across the project.

**Description:**
To maintain a high standard of code quality and prevent common errors from entering the codebase, automated checks should be integrated into the development workflow.

**Subtasks (from tasks.md):**
- Implement pre-commit hooks (e.g., `black`, `flake8`, `mypy`) to enforce code quality.
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow for linting, type-checking, and unit tests on PRs.
