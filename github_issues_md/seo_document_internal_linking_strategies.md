This issue is for documenting internal linking strategies for the website.

**Description:**
Effective internal linking improves SEO by distributing page authority, helping search engines understand site structure, and guiding users through relevant content. This task involves formalizing a strategy for internal links.

**Subtasks (from plan):**
- Document internal linking strategies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Guidelines for creating internal links within episode descriptions, blog posts, and other content are established and documented.
- Content creators are aware of and follow the internal linking strategy.
- Regular audits for broken internal links are conducted (leveraging `link_checker.py`).
