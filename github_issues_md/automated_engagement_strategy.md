This issue is for implementing a new tool, `scripts/sentiment_analyzer.py`, to enhance the automated engagement strategy for social media.

**Description:**
To move beyond basic automated responses, this tool will analyze the sentiment and context of social media interactions, enabling `engagement_automator.py` to provide more nuanced and appropriate responses.

**Subtasks (from tasks.md):**
- Integrate sentiment analysis into `engagement_automator.py` for more nuanced responses.
- Use LLMs for contextual response generation.

**Additional Automation Opportunities (from previous analysis):**
- **Identify Influencers:** Detect and prioritize engagement with influential accounts.
