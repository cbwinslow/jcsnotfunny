This issue is for implementing a new tool, `scripts/predictive_analytics.py`, for advanced analytics and predictive insights.

**Description:**
To move beyond historical reporting, this tool will leverage advanced analytics and machine learning to forecast content performance, segment audiences, and proactively suggest optimization strategies and A/B tests.

**Subtasks (from tasks.md):**
- Implement predictive modeling for content performance and audience segmentation.
- Suggest automated A/B tests for content.

**Additional Automation Opportunities (from previous analysis):**
- **Automated Experimentation:** Suggest A/B tests or multivariate tests for content formats, posting times, or messaging.
