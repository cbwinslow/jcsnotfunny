This issue is for implementing dynamic meta tag injection to integrate local keywords, specifically targeting "comedy podcast roanoke, va".

**Description:**
To improve ranking for local search queries, key on-page elements such as page titles and meta descriptions need to dynamically incorporate local keywords. This task involves leveraging the `SEOPackage` generated by `scripts/seo_tools.py`.

**Subtasks:**
- Ensure `SEOPackage` (from `scripts/seo_tools.py`) is used to dynamically inject local keywords into page titles (`<title>` tag) and meta descriptions.
- Integrate local keywords into heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) on the homepage, local landing page, and relevant episode pages.
- Mention "Roanoke, VA" as the podcast base, local venues, or local comedy scene in episode notes, blog posts, or an "About Us" section.
- Use alt text for images (e.g., episode art, host photos) that includes "comedy podcast Roanoke VA".
- This will likely involve modifying `website_updater.py` or the website build process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Website pages dynamically display correct titles, meta descriptions, and canonical URLs with local keywords.
- Heading tags on relevant pages include local keywords.
- Content body mentions local context.
- Image alt text incorporates local keywords.
- Changes made to metadata are reflected on the website without manual intervention.
