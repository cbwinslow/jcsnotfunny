This issue is for enhancing the existing trend monitoring and content creation scripts to enable proactive trend hijacking.

**Description:**
To maximize content visibility and audience engagement, this task aims to upgrade the trend monitoring and content creation processes to identify and capitalize on emerging trends more rapidly and effectively.

**Subtasks (from tasks.md):**
- Enhance with real-time trend analysis and automated content drafting for quick human review.

**Additional Automation Opportunities (from previous analysis):**
- **Real-time Trend Analysis:** More aggressive, real-time monitoring of trends.
- **Predictive Trending:** Attempt to predict emerging trends to create content *before* it peaks.
- **Automated Content Drafting:** Upon detection of a highly relevant trend, automatically draft social media posts/short video ideas, ready for quick human review and posting.
