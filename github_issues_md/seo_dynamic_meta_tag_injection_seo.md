This issue is for ensuring dynamic SEO meta tag injection into the website's HTML, leveraging the `SEOPackage` generated by `scripts/seo_tools.py`.

**Description:**
To maximize search engine visibility and ensure accurate content representation, the metadata generated by `scripts/seo_tools.py` needs to be dynamically injected into the `<head>` section of each web page.

**Subtasks (from plan):**
- Ensure the `SEOPackage` generated by `scripts/seo_tools.py` is correctly injected into the HTML `<head>` of each web page (episode pages, etc.), dynamically rendering `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `<link rel="canonical">`, Open Graph tags, and JSON-LD structured data.
- This will likely involve modifying `website_updater.py` or the website build process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Website pages dynamically display correct titles, meta descriptions, and canonical URLs with local keywords.
- Open Graph tags are correctly populated for social media sharing.
- JSON-LD structured data (`PodcastEpisode` schema) is correctly embedded in episode pages.
- Changes made to metadata are reflected on the website without manual intervention.
