This issue is for developing and documenting a comprehensive keyword strategy for each episode and related content.

**Description:**
To maximize search engine visibility and target relevant audiences, a well-defined keyword strategy is essential for every piece of content produced. This task focuses on establishing guidelines and a process for identifying and integrating primary and secondary keywords.

**Subtasks (from plan):**
- Develop a comprehensive keyword strategy for each episode.
- Ensure `metadata_generator.py` includes a robust mechanism for adding episode-specific keywords.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A documented process for keyword research and selection is created.
- Guidelines for keyword integration into episode titles, descriptions, and transcripts are established.
- `metadata_generator.py` is updated to facilitate the inclusion of episode-specific keywords.
- Content creators are trained on the new keyword strategy.
