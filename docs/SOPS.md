# SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

Use this index to navigate the SOPs for each phase of production. Each SOP contains its own checklist and placeholders to update as tools and workflows mature.

## SOP Index
- `docs/SOPS_SHOW_PREP.md` - episode planning, guest info, and show prep checklists
- `docs/SOPS_SPONSORS_AND_PLUGS.md` - sponsor reads, disclosures, and guest plugs
- `docs/SOPS_LIVE_PRODUCTION.md` - OBS setup, pre-show checks, and multicast workflow
- `docs/SOPS_POST_PRODUCTION.md` - editing, audio mix, captions, and exports
- `docs/SOPS_CLIPS_SOCIAL.md` - clip creation, social copy, scheduling, validation
- `docs/SOPS_PUBLISHING.md` - release steps for YouTube, website, and socials
- `docs/SOPS_QA.md` - quality checks before release
- `docs/SOPS_BACKUP_ARCHIVE.md` - storage, backups, and archive strategy

## Operating Notes
- Keep checklists updated when tools or platforms change.
- Add new SOPs for any new workflow area (and link them here).
- Use `docs/DELIVERABLES.md` for export specs and targets.
