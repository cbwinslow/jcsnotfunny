# Copilot / Agents Instructions

Use these files to instruct automation or Copilot-style agents.

## Goals

- Automate ingest and transcription of raw footage
- Generate short clips based on transcripts and highlight detection
- Prepare deliverables and upload to YouTube / website

## Example prompts for agents

- "Ingest new footage from `raw_videos/2026-01-07_ep5`, generate proxies and add metadata JSON with timestamps and camera mappings."
- "Transcribe `raw_videos/ep5/audio_master.wav` to WebVTT and create time-coded highlights for top 10 keywords."

Keep prompts concise and include expected outputs and file locations.
