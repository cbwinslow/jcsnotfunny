# 24/7 Worker: scaffold, runbook, and deployment (Priority: high)

Summary

Create a continuously running agent (worker) that polls the task list (Project v2 / GitHub issues) and performs or proposes work. Start in **propose-only** mode (agent will comment or create draft PRs but not auto-claim or close issues). Provide Docker, systemd, and Kubernetes examples for deployment.

Acceptance criteria (measurable)

- A minimal worker scaffold exists (`agents/worker.py`) with a CLI and unit tests.
- Worker can run in `--dry-run`/`--propose-only` mode and process a sample task (unit test with mocked fetcher+executor).
- Dockerfile and `agents/docker-compose.yml` exist and can build an image.
- A 'systemd' example unit file is added for easy VM deployment.
- A GitHub issue is created and added to Project v2 (this issue).

Subtasks / microgoals

- Add `agents/worker.py` implementing poller, executor, and healthcheck endpoint.
- Add `agents/tasks/github_fetcher.py` with a pluggable fetch interface and a local-file fallback for dev.
- Add `agents/Dockerfile` and `agents/docker-compose.yml` and a sample `systemd` unit.
- Add `tests/test_worker.py` to validate polling + processing flow (mocked).
- Add documentation `docs/24-7-worker.md` (runbook and deployment steps).

Estimate: 2–3 days (scaffold + tests + docs)
